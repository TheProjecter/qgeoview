QGeoView is designed to be a cross-platform alternative to the windows-only GSAK for Geocaching.
The main objective is to allow users to store, sort, categorize, export and transmit geocaches.
In the future we also hope to support other gps data such as tracks and routes.

Current features being worked on (mostly in this order, but not strictly):
-GPX import
-GPX export
-Manual geocache creation (through the GUI)
-Geocache browsing and editing (descriptions, notes, logs, etc)
-Collections (for categorizing and organizing)

Features currently on the back-burner:
-Map: I am still searching for a lightweight map widget that works on an n810 and resizes within a split view.
-GPS support: both upload and download, will probably use gpsbabel either internally or through system call
